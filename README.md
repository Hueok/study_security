# Linux Command

#### `"ls -a"` :  (_THIS COMMAND INCLUDE DOUBLE QUOTATION_) In linux shell we can take command by using double quotation. But, command in double quotation is treated as single command including any spaces. So This command occur __syntax error__.  

#### The difference of `"` and `'` : Double quotation has variable substition while single quotation isn't. (Similar with f-string {})
